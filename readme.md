# Work
As a data analyst I use a lot of SQL, R, and Docker. Sometimes I write Python, but only if I have to. As I find myself presenting more to non technical audiences, I've grown to love revealjs slides in Quarto presentations.

I once had to know Excel inside and out. Not the most useful language for version control or data science in general. This led me to more actively seek out other projects to work on and document. However, I can now coerce Excel to do a lot of things it probably shouldn't, between the Windows API, VBA, PowerShell, and node.js.

**Languages**
- SQL
- R
- python
- DAX/m
- lua (when I get the itch to mess with my nvim config)
- Javascript (but only when I need to customize something in a shiny app)

- Snowflake (which is spectacular!)
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- DBT
